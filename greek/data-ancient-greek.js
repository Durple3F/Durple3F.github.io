		1: "This is just how you spell her name. As someone who is extremely unfamiliar with greek, it's weird that it's spelled with a short \"e\" epsilon, so I would <i>think</i> this is pronounced \"Kleh-oh-pah-trah\" but I'm just unfamiliar.",
		2: "To make the base word \"εξορίζω\" (ekso-RIzo) (\"to exile\") has a \"σε\" added to the end to make it have the kind of past-perfect meaning we need here. However, here it's not Cleo who <b>did</b> the exiling, she was the <b>subject</b> of the exiling. So we add a \"τος\" instead, which is a suffix that makes it past-perfect-participle instead, but only for some words, apparently.<br><a href=\"https://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/goodell/verbal-adjectives-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82-and-%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%BF%CF%82\"><cite>Meagan Ayer, ed.

		3: "I tried so hard to find a source for this exact spelling. I don't think \"pharaoh\" exists in this form in ancient greek, but it certainly does in modern greek. I think a true ancient greek text would just call her a queen or something, but only because they didn't have the word pharaoh.",
		4: "Mythic, legendary. Most people seem to translate it with option #1. It's pronounced \"mythikon\" so I'm inclined to agree.",
		5: "Notably, here they've used \"ὄν\" instead of the \"Θηρίον\" they used with Questing Phelddagrif. \"Θηρίον\" means, like, beast, or wild animal, so I can understand trying to avoid calling this real historical human a creature. Leonardo da Vinci does not get that luxury. \"ὄν\" seems to be a very vague word that just means \"being.\" Here, it's used as a noun, so it's <i>a</i> being and not... the state of existence. However, apparently that uses the same word. This word has evolved into the modern greek \"ον\" which still means being, but it also literally has \"creature\" right there on the wiktionary page.",
		6: "This seems to be like, \"man\" in the same sense as we use for \"mankind.\"",
		7: "I've found multiple sources using this as a word for \"noble\" in this sense.",
		8: "\"Σύμμαχοι\" is a verb meaning to fight alongside. It can also be used as a noun, though that meaning seems less common. It's used in Herodotus, so I trust that. Other possible words include \"ἐπίκουρος\" (helper, ally) or \"ἐπιτάρροθος\" (helper, defender).",
		9: "This second-person pronoun is even older than the greek equivalent of our old-timey-second-person pronoun \"thou.\" Like, imagine a \"thou\"-ier though",
		10: "\"τελευτάω\" has a lot of meanings related to endings. It seems to be a verb that means \"to finish.\" This word replaces the ending with \"αίου\" (pronounced ei-oo) which seems to modify the word so that it just means \"pertaining to\" the act of finishing.",
		11: "This means \"step\" in the \"footstep\" sense. The word seems heavily associated with walking. I suppose the word we use for step is also the same word we use for footsteps, but I think it's funny.",
		12: "This word is very close to the word for \"prince\" and it seems like a lot of translation tools get caught up on that, but I can find a single source where it's said this means \"at the beginning of\"",
		13: "This is a very broad guess, but I <i>think</i> this is where the \"target\" of \"two target creatures\" went. Greek grammar seems <i>weird.</i>",
		14: "This seems to be a VERY obscure word that appears to mean anything from \"entomb\" to \"excrete\" to \"grow upon\" and I picked the one I thought sounded the least weird.",
		15: "\"ἕκαστον\" is the pronoun form of \"ἕκαστος\" which means \"each\" or \"every.\" Why is this labeled as a pronoun when the english uses \"each\" as a determiner? No idea.",
		16: "I looked at this word, saw that it was 3 letters long, and assumed this had to be like, \"the\" or something. I didn't notice that it was literally the word \"duo\" but spelled in greek letters.",
		17: "Greek seems to have quite a lot of these articles that we simply would not put there in english. But there's also <i>less</i> articles than you'd expect a lot of the time? It seems so alien to me.",
		18: "This word seems to have a lot of meanings related to totality, quantity, and extent. However, I can't find anything to directly support this \"at most\" hypothesis.",
		19: "\"ἑτέρων\" is pronounced \"heteron\", and hey look I know what hetero means!",
		20: "This word <i>seems</i> to be derived from \"διωκτέος\" which means \"that must pursue or be pursued\" so I <i>think</i> they're going for a meaning that's like, it's chosen. It's indicated. You're looking at it when the ability resolves.",
		21: "This is a gender neutral (but like, masculine is the default in this language) plural version of ὄν",
		22: "The adjective form of \"προδοτικός\" (prodotikós, \"treacherous\") produced by adding an \"-ίᾱ\" to the end.",
		23: "\"ὁπότε\" (\"o-po-te\", which time) + \"ᾰ̓́ν\" (\"an\", conditionality) = when",
		24: "",
		25: "This word <i>seems</i> to be a pronoun that means \"something\" but why is it here? In the middle of an already existing noun?",
		26: "",
		27: "This word could mean branded, marked, known by police, lots of meanings involving some visible thing being on something.",
		28: "We've got a lot of data on this one, those wacky ancient greeks were dying all the time. Pronounced \"thneeski.\"",
		29: "How sad that the egyptian queen doesn't get a word for paper that comes from \"papyrus\"",
		30: "I'm very unclear exactly what this is supposed to do in the sentence. I think this whole sentence could be read like \"Take papers, equal to marks as many as there are\" or something like that.",
		31: "I found a quote from Herodotus in which this word is used to describe the way that the god Bacchus takes revelers when they perform a ritual. Anyway, this word means take. In the same number of senses of the word as \"take\" means for us.",
		32: "I am very unclear whether it's this word or \"τόσα\" that creates the sense of equality that the sentence needs. Is it both? I think so?",
		33: "This could mean anything from \"logo\" to \"signal\" but here it seems to mean something like \"mark\" or \"brand\"",
		34: "For whatever reason, greek has a whole bunch of articles in places we don't have them and a whole bunch less articles in places we do. This means something close to \"the.\"",
		35: "\"ἐστι\" (esti) means \"to be.\" Don't get me started.",
		36: "It is hilarious that the word for \"lose\" is the word for \"rob.\" This could also be translated as \"waste,\" or \"despoil\" which are both equally funny.",
		37: "Believe it or not, \"βίων\" (bion) means life.",
