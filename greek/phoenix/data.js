	"The First Turnabout": {
		1: "The word for Phoenix in Greek is just phoenix. It's phonetically identical. So like, the name still works, I guess. We're keeping it.",
		2: "This is a combination of the name \"Σωτήρης\" (means like savior / salvation) and the regular word \"Σωστός\" (means correct / right).",
		3: "We are JUST going with Mia. I can't find anything I like better and to HELL with the fact that 'mia' in Greek (without the accent) is basically like being named 'a'. Her last name if Φαι because it sounds like Fey.",
		4: "We're calling him Λάρι Φτιάχτης, which is just 'Larry' + the word for a culprit or someone who's at fault for something. In the original Japanese, his name basically just means 'Of course, I knew it' because, well, when something smells... Anyway, I'm not proud of this one. There's gotta be something cleverer. His name's basically just Larry Probably-Did-It, like this. Which is fine, I guess.",
		6: "So \"πόνος\" means \"pain\" and his last name here is the word for \"painful\" (οδυνηρός) but placed into a form that I <i>think</i> looks like a Greek surname.",
		7: "Cindy became Cynthia because that seems more common in Greek. Fun Fact: The name \"Peter\" actually derives directly from 'petra', the word for stone. Come to think of it, Petra can also be a name. Anyway, I was able to find people who actually have this surname, which is literally just 'Peter' + 'from/of', so it's like all of the -son names we have in English. Very happy with how this one turned out.",
		8: "So this is why I couldn't just use the word for stone for her name, that doesn't work for this pun here. The annoying bit was the first word here, because cinder blocks sound nothing like Cynthia in Greek. This first name here is the same word used in 'Mobile Phone'.",
		9: "You have no idea how glad I am that I was able to find several people actually, actively using this phrase. It's literally just the words for sugar and daddy next to each other, thank <i>god</i> it's so convenient.",
		10: "\"Να\" in this sense is suggestive, in the sense that you're proposing something. I don't think it would make grammatical sense to put a pronoun here to make the translation closer.",
		11: "Sorry Larry, I can't find a good euphemism. But for what it's worth, it seems like in Greek, there's not, like, a bad-word version of 'bitch'. It literally just means a female dog, as far as I can tell, and like, you can use it derogatorily, but it doesn't seem to carry the heavy derogatory meaning it does in English.",
		12: "Here's a fun thing: I've had Payne here say a more formal, technical way to say 'he's lying'. But the judge in these games is, y'know, baby, so he says the informal version.",
		13: "His last name here is a play on \"είδα\" meaning \"I saw.\" His first name is Frank (Φραγκ) because his name is Frank.",
		14: "Now that Phoenix is pretty sure this guy's the killer, he switches to less respectful speech towards him.",
		15: "Okay so obviously the word for 'nobody' doesn't have a 'body' at the end like in English, but we can get kinda close... the word for 'nobody' is 'kapyo' and the word for 'corpse' is 'ptoma' (not a silent p). So we can try and mash 'em together? Ka-ptoma? It's my best shot.",
		16: "Yeah we're just gonna have to give up on this lil pun. Sorry.",
		17: "Why does the game call the clock an Alarm Clock here? It never calls it an alarm clock ANYWHERE else. The Thinker statue is NOT an alarm clock, you have to manually ring it if you want to hear any noise at all! Why is it called an alarm clock like this??????????? Anyway this word is just ex-hypno-tiri, where the ex-hypno part is because you leave sleep, and the -tiri I think is just to make it a noun/tool.",
		18: "Ekana means 'I did'.",
		19: "Boy am I glad Phoenix cuts himself off here, I have no clue what a good translation of 'gold digger' might even be. It's one of those phrases where a literal translation would probably be <u>bad</u>.",
		20: "Not the most inspired change, but I mean, Harry is still a name in Greek, too.",
		21: "Okay, so obviously I haven't been going with the whole 'Butt' joke, but I think this gag here probably still retains some level of comedy. \"Harry Definitely-The-Guy-That-Did-It, Innocent!\"",
		22: "I looked it up this is a figurative phrase that kinda means what I want, I'm pretty sure. You untangled him from a precarious situation, I guess.",
		23: "Not qualified to figure out which of these syllables I can have fun with to make it sound the right kind of stupid"
