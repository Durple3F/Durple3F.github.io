New paragraph: The sky (which is above (the Manor of the Orzhov)) was dancing (figuratively) and had many colors which (moved because of magic which shined). The Orzhov bought each (fire-making-machine-building of the Izzet) (that was inside of the Tenth District) and made (the show of their power and great wealth) which was wastefully expensive. "Do you see?" said it, to the people who didn't receive an invitation due to their (state of lacking wealth and favor). "Do you see? The fact that we have many resources ready to use justifies our spending of them for these frivolities. Ravnica is safe. We are free to not worry and conserve for war-time." (The expense was calculated) and ((each burst of color) and (each blossom-illusion which fell from the sky) reminded (the people which lived in the shadow of the Syndicate of the Orzhov) of who saved them.)
