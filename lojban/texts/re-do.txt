To re-render:
1) Ashiok, Wicked Manipulator (used xancu instead of xance)
    - re-do the triggered ability of the nightmare tokens. right now the condition just says "there's an event of a combat-kind of phase" which sounds dumb
    - the nightmare also uses the wrong word for counters
    - the intervening if should use ifle
2) Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite
3) The Enigma Jewel
4) All of the LCI gods
    - Ojer Kaslem says dunla instead of danlu
5) Alquist Proft
    - Went and changed the name for the detective type
All of 'em, really. Types are written differently now.
