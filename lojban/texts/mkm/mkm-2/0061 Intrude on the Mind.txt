You reveal the 5 cards which are atop your library, and separate them into 2 piles. An opponent chooses 1 pile from those. You put the pile which was chosen into your hand and put the pile which was not chosen into your graveyard. You create a 0/0 colorless, thopter, artifact, and creature token which has "flies." For each X, which is a card which was put caused by this into your graveyard, put a +1/+1 counter on it.
