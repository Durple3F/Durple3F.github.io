				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>This is a collection of puzzles from my favorite parts of <a href="https://www.lingothegame.com/">Lingo</a>.
				</p>
				<p>While Lingo is a great game, it takes about 20 hours to get to the part of the game that this page simulates.
					See <a data-help-value="Opinions" href="#">Opinions</a> for a big ol' rant.</p>
				<p>So I'd rather just show you the good stuff. Each puzzle has annotations to tell you what exactly a given clue
					means, and I've even added some extra hints and clues in case those become necessary.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2>Opinions about Lingo</h2>
				<p>Lingo is a language-based puzzle game about guessing words based on clues you're given in a strange system
					governed by the colors and heights of boxes. I liked it. I did <em>not</em> like the 10+ hours of wandering
					around looking for where a specific puzzle was. The design of the world seems to actively avoid letting you
					know where you should be looking next.</p>
				<p><strong>BUT,</strong> eventually there are a few areas with puzzles that I really liked that were impossible
					to properly express in any way other than the bizarre system the game builds for describing the clues to the
					words it wants.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2>Credits</h2>
				<p>All puzzles shamelessly ripped from <a href="https://www.lingothegame.com/">Lingo</a>.</p>
				<p>Colorblind textures created by <a href="https://deusovi.github.io/">Deusovi</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2>How Lingo Works</h2>
				<p>Puzzles in Lingo are shown on panels on the sides of cubes. The height and color of the cube tells you some
					quality about the solution to the puzzle. Every puzzle has only one solution. Sometimes, puzzles combine
					together clues given by multiple cubes, and that's my favorite stuff in the game.</p>
				<h2>Height</h2>
				<p>Clues that are HIGH have to do with the SOUNDS of the word. For example, a clue might ask you to find a word
					that sounds the same as another word, or contains the same sounds but rearranged, or to write the sound that
					something makes, etc.</p>
				<p>Clues that are at a MIDDLE height have to do with the LETTERS that make up the word. For example, a clue
					might ask you to find an anagram of a word, or a word contained in another word.</p>
				<p>Clues that are LOW have to do with the DEFINITION of the word. These clues are the most varied. They ask you
					to take the rule given by the HIGH and MIDDLE meanings of whatever color the cube has and apply it to the
					literal concept given by the clue.</p>

				<h2>Colors</h2>
				<section style="color: var(--clue-white)">
					<h3>White (<a data-help-value="White" href="#">About</a>)</h3>
				</section>
				<section style="color: var(--clue-black)">
					<h3>Black (<a data-help-value="Black" href="#">About</a>)</h3>
				</section>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 style="color: var(--clue-white)">White - Unchanging</h2>
				<p>White clues ask you not to change the given word.</p>
				<p>A high white clue means the solution sounds the same as the given word.
					<br>Example: Way &#10132; Weigh, Right &#10132; Write, Depend &#10132; Deepened.
				</p>
				<p>A middle white clue means the solution is spelled the same as the given word. Those ones aren't very hard to
					solve.
					<br>Example: Antidisestablishmentarianism &#10132; Antidisestablishmentarianism
				</p>
				<p>A low white clue means the solution has <span style="font-size: 0.7em">(roughly)</span> the same meaning as
					the given word.
					<br>Example: Reveal &#10132; Uncover, Yell &#10132; Holler
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 class="white-outline" style="color: var(--clue-black)">Black - Reversal, Opposite, Complement</h2>
				<p>Black clues ask you to somehow reverse the given word.</p>
				<p>A high black clue means the solution sounds the same as the given word, but backwards.
					<br>Example: Cat &#10132; Tack
				</p>
				<p>A middle white clue means the solution is spelled the same as the given word. Those ones aren't very hard to
					solve.
					<br>Example: Antidisestablishmentarianism &#10132; Antidisestablishmentarianism
				</p>
				<p>A low white clue means the solution has <span style="font-size: 0.8em">(roughly)</span> the same meaning as
					the given word.
					<br>Example: Reveal &#10132; Uncover, Yell &#10132; Holler
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 style="color: var(--clue-red)">Red - Reduction</h2>
				<p>Red clues ask you to remove something from the given word. Notably, they don't change the order of whatever's
					left.</p>
				<p>A high red clue means that the sounds of the solution are present in the word, but there's some extra sounds
					there that need to be removed.
					<br>Example: Tolerant &#10132; Taunt. Yep, we're fully <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot%E2%80%93caught_merger">caught-cot merger</a> here.
				</p>
				<p>A middle red clue means that the letters of the solution are present in the word, but there's some extra
					letters that need to be removed.
					<br>Example: Hippopotamus &#10132; Pot
				</p>
				<p>A low red clue means that the solution is something that is contained within the given word, or something
					that the given word "has."
					<br>Example: Flower &#10132; Petal, Door &#10132; Doorknob
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 style="color: var(--clue-blue)">Blue - Addition</h2>
				<p>Blue clues ask you to take what's given to you and add to it somehow.</p>
				<p>A high blue clue means that the sounds of the solution include the sounds of the clue, but there's some extra
					sounds that need to be added. (The sounds might be a <em>bit</em> approximate.)
					<br>Example: Sun &#10132; Resonant, Lore &#10132; Lawnmower
				</p>
				<p>A middle blue clue means that each letter of the clue appears in the solution, in that order, but there's
					some extra letters that need to be added.
					<br>Example: Pony &#10132; Phony
				</p>
				<p>A low blue clue means that the clue is literally contained within the solution, or the solution "has" the
					clue as a part of it somehow.
					<br>Example: City &#10132; County, Tooth &#10132; Mouth
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 style="color: var(--clue-purple)">Purple - Replacement</h2>
				<p>Purple clues ask you to replace part of what's given to you. It's like <span
						style="color: var(--clue-red)"><a data-help-value="Red" href="#">Red</a></span> and <span
						style="color: var(--clue-blue)"><a data-help-value="Blue" href="#">Blue</a></span> at the same
					time. Cute, right?</p>
				<p><strong>It is intentionally very unclear exactly how much the solution may be different from the
						clue.</strong></p>
				<p>A high purple clue means that while some of the sounds of the correct word are present, you'll need to
					replace some of the other sounds.
					<br>Example: Depend &#10132; Descend, Trouble &#10132; Bubble
				</p>
				<p>A middle purple clue means that while some of the letters of the correct word are present, you'll need to
					replace some of the other letters.
					<br>Example: Trouble &#10132; Troubador
				</p>
				<p>A low purple clue means that the definition of the clue has to be somehow modified to get to the answer.
					<br>Example: Cucumber &#10132; Pickle
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 style="color: var(--clue-yellow)">Yellow - Rearranging</h2>
				<p>Yellow clues ask you to change the placement of the parts of the clue.</p>
				<p>A high yellow clue means that the sounds of the clue need to be shuffled in some way to get the solution.
					<br>Example: Fine &#10132; Knife
				</p>
				<p>A middle yellow clue means that the solution is an anagram of the clue.
					<br>Example: State &#10132; Taste
				</p>
				<p>A low yellow clue means that the solution is what you get when you shuffle together the clue.
					<br>Example: Fruits &#10132; Smoothie
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 style="color: var(--clue-brown)">Brown - Evolution</h2>
				<p>Brown clues ask you to write what chronologically follows the given clue.</p>
				<p>A middle brown clue means that the solution is the way that the clue would be spelled later.
					<br>Example: Hail &#10132; Hi, God Be With You &#10132; Goodbye
				</p>
				<p>A low brown clue means that the answer happens after the clue happens.
					<br>Example: Rain &#10132; Rainbow
				</p>

				<h2><span style="color: var(--clue-brown)">Brown</span> & <span style="color: var(--clue-black)"
						class="white-outline">Black</span> - The Opposite of That</h2>
				<p>There's no good color that's the opposite of brown!</p>
				<p>One of these weird little checkerboard clues means that you need to say what comes <em>before</em> the clue
					instead.
					<br>Example: Present &#10132; Past
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 style="color: var(--clue-magenta)">Magenta - Specification</h2>
				<p>Magenta clues ask you to find a more specific example of the given clue.</p>
				<p>A high magenta clue asks you to write the sound made by the clue.
					<br>Example: Crow &#10132; Caw, Lion &#10132; Roar
				</p>
				<p>A middle magenta clue means that the solution is an example of the given <em>kind</em> of word. Usually this
					is like, a part of speech.
					<br>Example: Conjunction &#10132; But
				</p>
				<p>A low magenta clue means that the solution is an example of the given <em>kind</em> of thing.
					<br>Example: Color &#10132; Chartreuse
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 style="color: var(--clue-lime)">Lime - Generalization</h2>
				<p>Lime clues ask you to take the clue and say what kind of thing it is. It's the opposite of <span
						style="color: var(--clue-magenta)"><a data-help-value="Magenta" href="#">Magenta</a></span>, but
					we ran out of colors that have good opposites.</p>
				<p>A high lime clue asks you to write what makes that noise.
					<br>Example: Tick &#10132; Clock
				</p>
				<p>A middle lime clue means that the solution is the kind of word shown in the clue.
					<br>Example: The &#10132; Article
				</p>
				<p>A low lime clue means that the solution is the kind of thing in the clue.
					<br>Example: Kumquat &#10132; Fruit
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2 style="color: var(--clue-lavender)">Lavender - Surroundings</h2>
				<p>Lavender clues ask you to say what surrounds the clue.</p>
				<p>A low lavender clue means that the solution surrounds the clue somehow.
					<br>Example: Room &#10132; Wall, Picture &#10132; Frame, Bird &#10132; Nest
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="topic">
				<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
				<p><span style="color: var(--clue-gray)">Gray</span> - Gray means something context-specific, for when the puzzle designer doesn't feel like their idea warrants a whole new color.</p>
				<p><span style="color: var(--clue-green)">Green</span> - Green blocks ask you to find something in the environment, which isn't going to matter much here in the Simulation Realm.</p>
				<p><span style="color: var(--clue-orange)">Orange</span> - Orange blocks transform the clue somehow, usually just putting the text through a cipher.</p>
				<p><span style="color: var(--clue-mint)">Mint</span> - Mint requires you to remember something from previous puzzles. You probably haven't played those puzzles if you're here. They might be a bit hard for you to solve.</p>
