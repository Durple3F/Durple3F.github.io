Move type icons by Elginive at https://github.com/Elginive/pokemon-type-icons

Pokeball Icon taken from specifically the Inuktitut Wikipedia, because that was the first one to show up on google. https://iu.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pok%C3%A9_Ball_icon.svg

All trainer icons are from https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/trainers/
Also the pokemon cries are from there too https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/audio/cries/

The image of the briefcase at the beginning is AI generated, I wasn't happy with how well I could remove the pokeballs myself.
