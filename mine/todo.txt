- at large miner counts, get the computer to remember some of the miners that were rendered last time, so that they'll be guaranteed to render next frame.

- add a selector to determine what amount of upgrades to buy

- start working on simulating massive amounts of ticks! obviously going to be important later!
  - maybe just use bonusTime approach?

- depth markers on the canvas, so you can see how deep you've gotten?
- add some keyboard shortcuts to return to the origin, far left, far right, bottom stuff.
